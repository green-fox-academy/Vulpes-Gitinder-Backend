## About the project
Gitinder is a Tinder-inspired app with a programmer-theme.  
You connect to it through your GitHub account and then it lets you get in touch with programmers with similar coding habits and interests. 
 
## Features:
- view other programmer's multiple snippets of code
- provides a list of matches (programmers that you swiped right on, that swiped right on you)
- settings, where you can enable/disable notifications, background synchronization and the max distance of the programmer
